0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

1. if/else statements:
If/else statements in Python are used to conditionally execute code.

2. Loops:
Loops are used to iterate over a sequence of items or perform a set of instructions repeatedly. Python supports two types of loops: for loops and while loops.

* For loop: A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence of elements.
* While loop: A while loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is true.

3. Functioins:
Functions in Python are blocks of code that can be called multiple times throughout a program. They allow you to organize your code into reusable chunks and make your code easier to maintain.
